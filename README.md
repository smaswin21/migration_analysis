**IE 404 : Team Not Found**

## Missing Migrants Project

The dataset provided by the Missing Migrants Project tracks the deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have perished or gone missing during the process of migration towards international destinations. It spans the years from 2014 to 2024, encompassing significant periods of global migration activity. It's important to note that   these data represent minimum estimates, as many migrant deaths during migration remain unrecorded. The dataset includes information on attempted crossings of the Mediterranean  Sea from 2016 to 2024, detailing arrivals in Europe, interceptions by North African and Turkish Coast Guards, as well as migrant deaths and disappearances.


**Objectives of the analysis:**
1. Understanding Migration Patterns: Analyze trends in migrant deaths, arrivals in Europe, and interceptions by authorities to understand migration dynamics, especially in the Mediterranean.

2. Identifying Risk Factors: Identify factors contributing to migrant deaths, such as routes, seasons, and demographics, to inform risk reduction strategies.

3. Informing Policy and Intervention: Provide insights for policy-makers and intervention efforts to improve migration management and protect vulnerable migrants.

4. Raising Awareness: Highlight the human toll of irregular migration and advocate for international cooperation and humanitarian responses to address migrant safety.

## Roadmap

### Enhanced Data Sources

To enrich our dataset and provide a more comprehensive understanding of migration dynamics, we have incorporated additional sources:

- **Social Media Monitoring**: We have implemented a social media monitoring system to gather real-time data and insights from various platforms. This allows us to capture public discourse, sentiments, and emerging trends related to migration issues.

- **Official Government Reports & NGO Data**: We have integrated official government reports and data from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to complement our dataset. These authoritative sources provide valuable statistics and insights into migration patterns, challenges, and interventions.

### Expanded Variables

In order to capture a more nuanced picture of migrant demographics and experiences, we have expanded our dataset to include additional variables:

- **Gender, Age, Family Size, etc.**: We have scraped data on gender, age, family size, and other relevant demographics to better understand the composition and needs of migrant populations. This allows us to analyze migration trends and outcomes through a more intersectional lens.

### Integration with Policy Tools

To facilitate informed decision-making and policy development, we have integrated our platform with policy tools and frameworks:

- **APIs and Plugins for Policy Integration**: We have developed APIs and plugins to seamlessly integrate our platform with existing policy frameworks used by governments and international organizations (IOs). This enables policymakers to access relevant data, insights, and analysis directly within their workflow, enhancing the efficacy of migration policies and interventions.
